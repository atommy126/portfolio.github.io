                                been designed to withstand the anomalous conditions created by an uncontained rift. Your
                                suit is your lifeline, you must keep it powered to stay alive. As you descend to the

                                start with after the summary. Soon after writing it, I realized that development started
                                much earlier. Development really started with the Wikipedia articles during my lunch
                                breaks. I eventually got to articles about cryptids and other myths surrounding isolated
                                research facilities, and I found myself thinking that it would be an interesting concept
                                for a game. I soon began sketching characters, designs, and user interfaces, as well as
                                writing down my notes for potential game mechanics. After the next week or so I had
                                gathered enough ideas and wireframes to start creating something, so when I got home I
                                got to work.

                                Before I started programming, I realized that I wanted a lot of control over different
                                elements, so I decided to use the Monogame framework instead of a game engine. I was
                                also interested in how different elements worked at their base level, so building them
                                myself seemed like a good approach. My next step was getting buttons working, so the
                                game had some amount of interactivity. After that, I began researching Monogame shaders
                                that could give me some kind of CRT effect. I quickly found an open-source set of
                                shaders and tweaked them to my liking. The next parts of development were largely the
                                creation of new kinds of buttons, like radio buttons and toggle buttons. Development
                                continued on like that for a while, where I was primarily implementing different
                                elements that the game needed to function.

                                Near the end of May 2025, I had almost every vital menu implemented, as well as many of
                                the important game mechanics, such as player map movement, combat, and the chip system.
                                This was everything essential to the intended gameplay loop, but something felt off. I
                                thought about it for a while, until I realized something very important about the game.
                                It wasn't fun. It wasn't the lack of polish that was the problem, the game was missing
                                something major. I thought about the balance of the game for a while, and decided that
                                WARD's primary issue was a skill issue. The game had plenty of strategy and luck
                                elements to it, which can make a perfectly fine game on their own. But WARD didn't have
                                enough of either to account for zero skill elements. To fix that, I decided to add a new
                                mechanic, sequences.

                                Sequences are essentially minigames that the player must complete during combat. The
                                number, type, and difficulty of sequences is impacted by various factors, such as the
                                player's chips and enemies present. Most sequences are either pass or fail, though some
                                have a spectrum of outcomes. For example, basic chips may increase damage done on a
                                successful sequence, while another chip may add different damage types depending on the
                                positions of different sliders. Enemies also have sequences that add an extra challenge
                                for the player, such as regions that cause damage and visual distortion when moused
                                over.

                                Chips are WARD's upgrade system. Each chip provides some kind of effect to the player,
                                depending on type. Some chips are passive, while others require a completed sequence to
                                have an impact. What makes chips interesting is their ordering, which can be changed at
                                will outside of combat. Chips apply in a set order, depicted in the inventory by arrows.
                                When I designed this system, I wanted the player to use strategy when deciding where to
                                place chips. I plan to create chips that grant great benefits while imposing a cost,
                                such as a chip that doubles one damage type while zeroing another. These mechanics add
                                more thought to choosing upgrades, and the system is even more complex when unmovable
                                corrupted chips are added into the mix.
