                                Crazy crops is a farming-themed tabletop card game. There are four types of cards: Crop
                                Cards, Curse Cards, Blessing Cards, and Weather Cards. One Crop Card can be planted per
                                turn, and each player can only have a total of three planted at once. Crop Cards start
                                at age 1, and all increase in age by 1 at the start of their owner's turn. Once they
                                reach their maturity age, they can be harvested for points or other effects. Players may
                                play as many Blessing and Curse Cards as they wish to per turn. Blessing Cards provide
                                beneficial effects, and Curse Cards cause negative effects. Weather Cards cause effects
                                that impact all players, and when one is drawn, it comes into play immediately.

                                I came up with the concept for the game, as well as game mechanics, card design, and
                                card text. I then led a team of four in the production of the game, physical cards, and
                                tabletop simulator port. We also kept detailed design documentation on our design
                                process and decisions, which I made sure was regularly updated throughout the game's
                                development.

                                A major point during development was the first playtest. For this playtest, we used
                                physical card prototypes, which were just index cards with handwritten card text and
                                sketches. I was supervising the playtest and taking notes, and the game played out
                                smoothly for its first time being played with players outside of the development team.
                                However, there were a number of rules clarifications that had to be made and questions
                                on card text wording. After the playtest, I made rules adjustments based on my notes and
                                the data obtained from a playtest survey we created. I also took notes during our other
                                playtests, which helped a ton when balancing the game.

                                To keep the game consistent, I created a standard for the card text wording. I wanted to
                                keep card text as short and simple as possible, while still allowing for complex card
                                combinations. I also wanted to avoid using too many keywords, as they tend to appear
                                intimidating to players who are unfamiliar with the game. All keywords used are
                                explained within the rules document. Other keyword-like card properties are explained on
                                the card, which makes the game much easier for newer players. I also balanced cards
                                around a point per turn system, which helped me design both weaker and stronger cards.

                                Cards were also designed to increase interaction between players. For example, the Reap
                                Curse Card can be used to harvest any fully grown Crop Card on the board. Harvesting on
                                your own turn is free, so there is little point to playing it on your own cards.
                                However, opponents are likely to harvest their Crop Cards as soon as they are fully
                                grown, so one of the best uses of the Reap Card is to play it with a Blessing Card, like
                                Fertilizer. Fertilizer increases the age of any Crop Card, so you can use it to grow an
                                opponent's crop, then play Reap and steal the rewards from them.

                                I also created a standardized design for all of the cards. I first decided on a basic
                                layout and color scheme. Crazy Crops' target audience included younger players, and was
                                likely to be played with family and friends. This led me to choose pastel springtime
                                colors for the cards, with colors being symbolic for each type of card. I also chose
                                Noto Serif as the font for the cards, as the serifs improved card readability and
                                created a serious, yet still inviting tone. The cards have a large space for the image
                                to go, which makes cards more visually distinctive, while still leaving room for a
                                sizable area for rules text.
