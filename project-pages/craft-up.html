                                resources in order to craft gear. Craft-Up was developed by a team of 4, including
                                myself. The game was created using Monogame, and was in development for four months To
                                make quick progress on the game, the team used Git to allow for the team members to work
                                simultaneously.

                                During the early stages of development, I was responsible for handling the player's
                                class, movement, and collisions with tiles. I then became in charge of developing
                                enemies. Since this was a project for class, one of the requirements was to create an
                                external tool that would assist in the development of the game. To meet that
                                requirement, I created an enemy creator, which included various fields for stats,
                                sprites, and enemy type. There were two major types of enemies in the game, melee and
                                ranged. Melee enemies would run straight at the player, while ranged enemies had a
                                radius from the player they would attempt to stay in. There were three difficulties of
                                each enemy, and the more dangerous variants would become more common as time progressed.
                                I had originally wanted to give each enemy their own unique behavior, but time
                                constraints only allowed for the implementation of the two major behaviors.

                                I was also in charge of handling combat and balancing damage values. Tool functionality
                                was covered by another team member, so I based the combat system off of the tool
                                swinging mechanic. I gave all tools range, arc, speed, and damage attributes, which were
                                used to determine whether a swing hit an enemy or not. When hit, enemies would enter a
                                stunned state, receive knockback, and flash to indicate that they were hit.

                                During the development of Craft-Up, we performed playtests to collect data and improve
                                our game. We created a survey to collect feedback from playtesters, and I also sat and
                                observed playtesters, noting initial reactions to mechanics and player instincts. Many
                                important issues were discovered through this process, and I was able to analyze the
                                data to reduce the difficulty curve of the game by reducing the numbers and difficulties
                                of enemies early on.
